<h2>UW Freelancer Profile Widget</h2>


<p>One of the first things an employer does before awarding a project to you on
freelancer.com is viewing your profile page. Your profile page consists of
useful, and sometimes critical, information about you and your activities on
freelancer.com. UW Freelancer Profile Widget lets you to display your
freelancer.com Profile Information on your site.</p>

<p>Even if you are a freelancer, you usually visit the project posters profile
page before accepting the project. Employers can use the UW Freelancer Profile
Widget to show their freelancer.com profile in their website. UW Freelancer
Affiliate Project Listing Widget, another UW Freelancer Widget, could be used
by an employer to list their latest projects on freelancer.com. You can
configure &#8216;project owner&#8217; setting in the UW Freelancer Dashboard. The default
settings pull projects from all employers. This allows a freelancer to visit
the employer site, learn more about him and bid on a project which is a better
match to his skills and that is posted by the employer on freelancer.com.</p>

<p><img src="/images/uw-freelancer/uw-freelancer-profile-widget.png"
alt="uw-freelancer-profile-widget" title="UW Freelancer Profile Widget" ></p>

<p>UW Freelancer Profile Widget is highly configurable. You can turn on and off
any component in the widget. You can use the theme customizer section
especially developed for UW Freelancer Plugin to change the styling and view
the effect of the corresponding changes before going live. Furthermore there
are hooks (filters) which allows you to completely alter the content of UW
Freelancer Profile Widget.</p>

<p>After installing the UW Freelancer Plugin, it has the default username value.
You need to change this settings field to your freelancer.com username. That is
the only change you need to do. After you add the widgets to one of your
sidebars, it starts to display your freelancer.com details to your audience. If
the most of your visitors are not aware of freelancer.com you can display
freelancer.com logo on top of your profile widget. This option is disabled by
default. But you can enable the logo section within UW Freelancer Dashboard.</p>

<p>Another profile component that is disabled by default is the &#8216;Job List&#8217;. This
is the long list of jobs you can bid on freelancer.com. UW Freelancer Plugin
settings allows you to display the job list at the end of the UW Freelancer
Profile Widget.</p>

<h2>Why Should I Use UW Freelancer Widgets?</h2>


<p>Can&#8217;t I just create a page containing freelancer.com details? Yes you can. But
you will need to update it frequently as you work on projects at
freelancer.com.</p>

<p>E.g. UW Freelancer Profile Widget contains a component called &#8216;number of
projects done&#8217;. If you manually write a page for your freelancer.com profile,
you need to update it after each project completion (Or at least after a number
of projects) Alternatively you can use the UW Freelancer Profile Widget which
automatically updates your profile information using freelancer.com API. You
can set the update interval using the transient timeout setting in the UW
Freelancer Dashboard.</p>

<p>Another instance of where this kind of automatic update is convenient is the UW
Freelancer Feedback Widget. The list of feedbacks automatically updates with
the latest feedback you received on freelancer.com. Otherwise you will need to
manually update the freelancer feedback details on your site.</p>

<h2>UW Freelancer Feedback Widget</h2>


<p>Receiving a good feedback after the successful completion of a freelance
project is very important for a freelancer, as well as for an employer.
Freelancer.com allows you to provide a rating and a feedback after each project
completion.</p>

<p>For a freelancer having good feedback history or reputation on freelancer.com
enable them to attract more trust and gain more attention from employees than
the freelancers without having a good feedback. UW Freelancer Feedback Widget
can be used to show the feedbacks you received on your WordPress site.</p>

<p><img src="/images/uw-freelancer/uw-freelancer-feedback-widget.png"
alt="uw-freelancer-feedback-widget" title="UW Freelancer Feedback Widget" ></p>

<p>UW Freelancer Profile Widgets enables you to display your profile information
whereas UW Freelancer Feedback Widget enables you to display your feedbacks for
your freelancing projects. If you are a freelancer and your site contains
information about the projects you have done, using the UW Freelancer Widgets,
you are more likely to communicate your knowledge/skills and experience than
those who don&#8217;t use UW Freelancer Widgets. This focused communication
effectively enables you to attract more attention from the employers. UW
Freelancer Widgets enables you to get more projects as a freelancer.</p>

<p>Freelancers don&#8217;t like to work with employers with bad feedback. To compensate
the risk of working with a bad employer, freelancers will raise their bids. If
you an employer with good feedback you can showcase the feedback you received
in your site using UW Freelancer Feedback Widget. A single freelancer.com
account lets you to operate both as a freelancer and a project poster. You can
select which type of feedback you need to display by visiting UW Freelancer
Dashboard and configuring the settings fields. This setting defaults to show
the freelancer feedback. Select employer from the dropdown menu to show
employer feedback.</p>

<p>Similar to profile widget, UW Freelancer Feedback Widget too queries the
freelancer.com API to obtain the information. Query string is formed using the
settings you specify in the UW Freelancer Dashboard. The API responses are
stored in the WordPress transients to prevent frequent API queries per each
visitor to your site. The lifetime of UW Freelancer Transients are controlled
globally via freelancer dashboard.</p>

<p>Number of feedback items to display is configurable. The default is four. Each
component in a feedback can be turned on or off using settings. The styling you
change for profile widget applies to all UW Freelancer Widgets. You can visit
theme customizer section and browser to a page where you can see the UW
Freelancer Feedback Widget within the theme customizer. After changing the
styling or the appearance of the widgets you can save the setting for all
widgets. Remember the changes you make applies to all widgets.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can hook into a filter related to UW Freelancer Feedback
Widget in your functions.php and do the modifications. Your custom function
will be given all the data that were used to generate the UW Freelancer
Feedback Widget. For more information please see the documentation on WordPress
Freelancer Hooks API.</p>

<h2>UW Freelancer Affiliate Widget</h2>


<p>You need to pay a service charge to freelancer.com for each project you
complete on freelancer.com for their service. If you refer a person to
freelancer.com you are given a portion of the payment each time the referred
person pays for freelancer.com.</p>

<p>You can refer your friends or visitors to freelancer.com by listing freelancer
projects on your WordPress site. UW Freelancer Affiliate Widget lets you to
list relevant affiliate projects easily in your sidebar.</p>

<p>When you list a projects as an affiliate you need to construct a special url
containing your affiliate name using the &#8216;aff&#8217; parameter. This is not just
adding the query argument to the project url. UW Freelancer Affiliate Widget
queries the freelancer.com api to obtain this affiliate urls with other
descriptions about the projects.</p>

<p>Affiliate username is same as the freelancer.com username. UW Freelancer
Affiliate Widget get the username from the profile widget settings. Unlike the
other widgets UW Freelancer Affiliate Widget doesn&#8217;t query freelancer.com API
within the server and store responses in the transients, instead it queries the
freelancer.com API from the users browser and use Javascript to display/format
the json response. This is preferred because of the frequent changes in the
project list due to frequent new project postings.</p>

<p>If you are prefer not to use Javascript in your site you can hook into the
widget output filter and output the complete widget content instead of query
url and the Javascript. However you will need to set transients timeout to a
reasonable time to auto update the UW Freelancer Affiliate Listing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/uw-freelancer/uw-freelancer-affiliate-widget.png"
alt="uw-freelancer-affiliate-widget" title="UW Freelancer Affiliate Widget" ></p>

<p>You can configure which information should be displayed for each affiliate
project. If you just want to list only the featured projects you have an option
for that within UW Freelancer Affiliate Widget. The default setting lists
freelancer projects for WordPress. You can select the relevant projects to
your site by setting the relevant keyword setting field.</p>
